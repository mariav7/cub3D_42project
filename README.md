## Project

[**Subject PDF**](misc/en.subject.pdf)

The purpose of cub3D is to render a 3D maze in [C](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language) using the graphic library [miniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) and using [raycasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting), inspired by the iconic game [Wolfenstein3D](https://www.snokido.fr/jeu/wolfenstein-3d).

The project encourages a deep understanding of graphics programming and serves as a hands-on exploration of classic video game rendering techniques.
